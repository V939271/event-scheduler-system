        ##  Next Steps

        You‚Äôve now:

            Written working Python 3.x REST API using Flask  
            Saved data with persistence  
            Added usage examples and command outputs  
            Uploaded the project to GitHub  
            Documented everything in README

            Let me know if you want to:
            - Add recurring event logic
            - Add background reminders with threading
            - Deploy to the cloud (like Render or PythonAnywhere)
